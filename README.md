### Project overview
Analyzing Amazon reviews with natural language processing techniques to uncover key topics (product features) discussed across a category of products. Topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation applied to reviews for bluetooth headsets. Topics discovered corresponded to specific product characteristics (e.g. "voice command function", "sound quality") and holistic assessments ("great overall", "cheap", and "use in active lifestyle"). Output can be used for such business cases as:
- By customers: prioritizing products with relevant features  
- By seller / manufacturer: monitor product perception to improve design and service
